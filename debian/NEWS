gmpc (0.13.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    This new version of gmpc uses a new configuration file.  Your 0.12.0
    configuration files will not be compatible with this release.

    gmpc will work with mpd 0.11.5 in Debian, but it also supports
    features found in the as-yet unreleased mpd 0.12.0.  I've packaged
    SVN snapshots of the in-progress mpd 0.12.0 here:

        http://musicpd.org/~normalperson/debian/experimental/

    This is the first version of gmpc to support plugins.  They are
    available at:

        http://cms.qballcow.nl/index.php?page=Plugins

    I do not plan on packaging any of them for Debian at this time.
    You will need to install the new gmpc-dev to compile plugins.
    You are more than welcome to package them for Debian yourself :)
